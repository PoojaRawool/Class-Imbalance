# Class-Imbalance
•Select an imbalanced classification dataset . E.g. wilt , fish, pulsar dataset from UCI (Note that we will convert it into a 2 class problem, where required)<br>
•Perform EDA and Preprocessing<br>
•Use Logistic Regression for classification<br>
•Use the following techniques <br>
•RUS<br>
•ROS<br>
•SMOTE<br>
•Use Logistic Regression for classification of modified dataset<br>
•Compare the following metrics with and without class imbalance<br>
•Accuracy<br>
•Precision<br>
•Recall<br>
•AUC (for this use predict_probato get probabilities required)
